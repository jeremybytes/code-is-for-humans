# Code is for Humans  

The computer understands your code just fine. But what about humans? The world is constantly changing, and your applications need to change with it. Humans make those changes; sometimes it's you, sometimes it's someone else. So let's look at some practical techniques to keep code readable, such as working in small pieces, coming up with good names for methods and objects, and avoiding "clever" code. Think about the next developer who needs to change this code. Often that developer is you from six months in the future. Your future self will thank you.
